SimpleEvent.pm:
==============
0.1: first public version
0.1a: fix remaining signal handlers not detected when main loop is stopped
      add debug messages
0.1b: support timers callback removing other timers when using internal event model (AnyEvent event model manages this correctly already)
      remove non-repeating timers before calling the callbacks (this allows the callback to re-add a timer with same name)
0.1c: fix forkCall not working properly when returned data are bigger than output buffers
0.2: add function to close all non-system file descriptors (can be useful when the close-on-exec flag is missing)
     add function to create a new detached/daemon process
0.3: fix race condition in socket handlers management when using internal event model
0.4: fix forkCall failing to retrieve call result when the fork request is queued
     fix forkCall failing to retrieve call result when the forked process runs for more than the half-closed socket system timeout
     fix forkCall failing to retrieve call result when the forked process exits before returned data have been received by the parent process
0.5: timers now properly support subsecond delay and intervals
     fix buggy console when event loop is stopped while a forked process is still running (Windows)
0.6: the forkProcess, forkCall and createWin32Process functions now also return a handle in addition to the PID
     add removeProcessCallback function to allow removing the process callbacks added with the forkProcess, forkCall and createWin32Process functions
     split the process reaping code from the process callback handling code to make the SIGCHLD signal handler safer (Linux)
     fix handle conflicts in forked processes: internal module data is now flushed at start in forked processes
     fix handle conflicts in Win32 processes: user handles inheritance is now disabled during Win32 process creation (Windows)
     add support for cmd.exe style redirections when creating Win32 processes (Windows)
     the event loop for the internal event model no longer waits for the end of the loop to check if it must be stopped (make the event loop stop faster)
     prevent using AnyEvent with the EV library on Windows system to avoid crashes (Windows)
     print time slice value in initialization message
     add accessors to internal data volumetry indicators
     fix some errors generating empty line after log message
     add debug messages when unqueuing processes
