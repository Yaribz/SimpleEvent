SimpleEvent.pm:
==============
0.1: first public version
0.1a: fix remaining signal handlers not detected when main loop is stopped
      add debug messages
0.1b: support timers callback removing other timers when using internal event model (AnyEvent event model manages this correctly already)
      remove non-repeating timers before calling the callbacks (this allows the callback to re-add a timer with same name)
0.1c: fix forkCall not working properly when returned data are bigger than output buffers
0.2: add function to close all non-system file descriptors (can be useful when the close-on-exec flag is missing)
     add function to create a new detached/daemon process
0.3: fix race condition in socket handlers management when using internal event model
0.4: fix forkCall failing to retrieve call result when the fork request is queued
     fix forkCall failing to retrieve call result when the forked process runs for more than the half-closed socket system timeout
     fix forkCall failing to retrieve call result when the forked process exits before returned data have been received by the parent process
0.5: timers now properly support subsecond delay and intervals
     fix buggy console when event loop is stopped while a forked process is still running (Windows)
