SimpleLog.pm:
============
0.1: first public version
0.1a: fix remaining signal handlers not detected when main loop is stopped
      add debug messages
0.1b: support timers callback removing other timers when using internal event model (AnyEvent event model manages this correctly already)
      remove non-repeating timers before calling the callbacks (this allows the callback to re-add a timer with same name)
